# Essay Assisstant in Terminal

## Functionality:
This program helps you organize essays for college/camp applications. Google Docs kinda works, but this is much more streamlined and its all stored locally

If you're a new user, add at least 3 (preferably 5+) before you use the AI 

This program helps you do the following all in your terminal:
1. Store, view, remove, and find essays you've written 
2. Compare prompts to previous ones you've written to help save time
3. Streamline writing w/ AI as a starting point

## Setup
1. Install node.js
2. Run "npm i ezessay"
3. navigate to the "ezessay" folder
4. Run "node ." (or "node index.js")

## Please note: 
This program is powered by HackClub's DeepSeek API, so don't abuse the AI features. If you find yourself using the AI excessively, just use DeepSeek with your own account and you can upload your essays here
